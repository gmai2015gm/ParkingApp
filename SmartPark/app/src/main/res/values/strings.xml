    <string name="app_info">Welcome to SmartPark!
        This app was made to provide information to people looking for parking in places where parking can be difficult.
        You can view parking lots within a specified range from your current location, view their reports made by others using the app, or make a report about a parking lot yourself!
        Provided are three buttons: Find Parking Lots, View Parking Lot Reports, and Settings.\n
        Find Parking Lots takes you to the Parking Lot Finder where you can specify a range to find all parking lots within the specified range from your current location.\n
        View Parking Lot Reports takes you to the parking lot reports page where you can view reports posted by other users and even post your own reports.\n
        Settings takes you to the settings page where you can change you settings.\n
        Thank you for using SmartPark!
